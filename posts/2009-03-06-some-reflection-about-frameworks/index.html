				<h1>Some reflection about frameworks</h1>
			</header>
			<div class="content">
				<p>One of the highlights of the <a href="http://parlezuml.com/softwarecraftsmanship/">Software Craftsmanship Conference 2009</a> came from outside the original programme. Someone had the excellent idea of proposing the following topic for an open space session: &ldquo;Why I hate frameworks&rdquo;. It was enough to get my attention and before I realised the room was so full that people had to sit on the floor to be able to participate.</p>
<p>The discussion obviously started with frameworks for Java. It seems everyone agrees that the enterprise culture of Java introduced a huge amount of tools many developers can&rsquo;t live without even though their actual benefits are at least questionable. The next question then was whether developers should be so dependent on such tools.</p>
<p>On one side they allow them to think on an higher level of abstraction and follow standards shared by many other professionals. As consequence it becomes easier to find people to work on these projects, specially if the most popular frameworks were chosen.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this approach produces a great number of programmers who only know how to work with those specific tools without even understanding the problems that are actually being solved. Then it becomes harder and harder to evaluate if a framework make people produce more and better.</p>
<p>A point most people agreed is that in some cases frameworks just move the complexity from one place to another, and the productivity at the end doesn&rsquo;t pay off. And in many cases when people start facing the problems brought by a framework it&rsquo;s normally at a stage where abandonning it means almost recreating the whole system from scratch.</p>
<p>The fact that many projects are trapped by frameworks brought up the question whether developers should be looking for libraries instead. It seems there&rsquo;s a lack of libraries because people prefer to develop their solutions integrated to frameworks and then reach a bigger community instead of just solving a problem in isolation and letting programmers mix and match tools to use.</p>
<p>At the end of the session there was no real conclusion on how justifiable is the hate towards framework. Instead, there was a common sentiment that programmers should be more responsible when choosing frameworks. And maybe a clear list of problems they are solving and comparing them with the new challenges they bring may be a good starting point.</p>
