Detailed justification to take a day off or a more extended holiday? No access to install other software in their work laptops?\nBe mindful of adding any friction like that. Unless people are onboard with the trade-off a restriction represents, it’ll just be another source of complaint and comparison when looking for another job.\nIn many cases, a Trust But Verify approach would be more suitable for reducing issues while still keeping people productive.\nAllow and encourage to continuously improve things Like any other person in the organisation, developers are well placed to identify their work issues. Not giving them space and autonomy to fix them is missing valuable opportunities to make the whole organisation better.\nThat shouldn’t be limited to improvements to the code. Better tools, processes, and working practices should also be up for grabs for those who see areas to improve.\nAllow and encourage to work with the broader organisation It’s still common for organisations to treat software development as an isolated function that turns requirements from team A into software that team B will run and C will maintain.\nAdult developers want to understand the “why”, help defining the “what”, and direct the “how”. That means collaborating with all the people impacted by their work.\nAt a minimum, the information flow needs to be available so they can make well-informed decisions. And in return, developers should be able to share constraints and implications of those directions in a way others can understand.\nHigh-performance organisations require cross-discipline/team collaboration, and great developers are well aware that their best output will come from working with other people.\nSupport career development Most adult developers don’t enjoy the Personal Development Plans (PDPs) their employers force them to define and follow. That becomes even worse when those become tied to career progression and salary reviews.\nOn the other hand, developers appreciate having good coaches or mentors they can refer to when they need support.\nFor more senior developers, this support often means providing a light-touch approach of giving them space to grow on their own but still giving feedback when asked or needed.\nAn appropriate allowance for learning (books, courses, going to conferences, etc.) is also welcome by developers at any level.\nSummary Hopefully, if those ideas sound like common sense, it probably means your company is already on the right track.\nOn the other hand, if those sound too hard or even impossible in your context, your organisation may be past the stage where treating developers like an adult is possible.\n",
