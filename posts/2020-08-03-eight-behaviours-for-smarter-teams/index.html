Share all relevant information\nBy sharing relevant information, including things that don’t support your point of view or preferred solution, you add to a shared pool of knowledge that the team can use to make better decisions.\n3. Use specific examples and agree on what important words mean\nTry to bring concrete, real-world scenarios to help address challenging issues. And don’t be afraid to check if the words you’re all using mean the same thing to everyone.\n4. Explain reasoning and intent\nThe reasoning is your train of thought (logic). The intent is where you’re planning to take it (purpose).\nBy sharing those two aspects, you spare people from guessing the meaning of your words and actions, avoiding misunderstandings.\n5. Focus on interests, not positions\nThere is usually more than one position that could satisfy people’s interests. By clearly identifying what people care about, you can design and commit to a solution that better meets everyone’s needs.\nMy favourite personal variation of “focus on interests, not positions” is “focus on the problem, not the solution”.\n6. Test assumptions and inferences\nWe take information from granted (assumptions) and draw conclusions about things we don’t know based on things we know (inferences).\nWhen you validate those, you create another source of learning and add to the pool of shared knowledge.\n7. Jointly design next steps\nSmart team members avoid deciding things unilaterally. By being transparent and curious, you’ll find yourself involving those who hold valuable information, as well as those who are likely to be affected.\nIt may take extra work to jointly decide the next steps, but this pays off in shared understanding and a higher level of commitment.\n8. Discuss undiscussable issues\nRelevant and negative issues are usually emotionally charged; therefore tend to be avoided by most teams. Personal behaviour, performance, or strong opposite positions are typical examples of such matters.\nThe good news is that the mechanics of the previous seven behaviours still apply when addressing undiscussable issues.\nThe ability to address undiscussable issues early and often is a deciding factor for teams who want to make good choices together.\nKey take aways\nSmart teams are good at sharing information, learning from each other, and accepting responsibility.
