Sometimes { and } are used to define Hashes. Other times those are actually blocks. The |city| is a parameter to that block, but for methods we define parameters using ( and ).

  <div class="post-content"><p>Last night I had a chance to coach at a <a href="http://codebar.io/">Codebar</a> event for the first time. They offer free basic programming and web development workshops to people who are underrepresented in the tech industry.</p>
<p>For me it was a great reminder of how difficult it is to learn how to code. Even though my student was following a &ldquo;getting started&rdquo; <a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html">tutorial</a>, the amount and complexity of new concepts involved was overwhelming at times. Luckily there were always small rewards (for both of us, mind) when each new concept &ldquo;clicked&rdquo; after getting a particular set of commands working.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">basket</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s2">&#34;apple&#34;</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&#34;banana&#34;</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="n">cities</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="s2">&#34;London&#34;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&#34;New York&#34;</span><span class="o">]</span>

<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">basket</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="s2">&#34;apple&#34;</span><span class="o">]</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">cities</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">]</span>

<span class="n">cities</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">each</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">city</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">city</span> <span class="p">}</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Looking at this simple piece of code, there are many syntax concepts we just take for granted:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> can be used to define an Array and to access elements in both Arrays and Hashes.</li>
<li>Sometimes <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> are used to define Hashes. Other times those are actually blocks.</li>
<li>The <code>|city|</code> is a parameter to that block, but for methods we define parameters using <code>(</code> and <code>)</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even the words I&rsquo;ve just used to describe them (access, element, define, parameter, block etc) are a whole new vocabulary to people new to programming. The tutorials do their best to introduce them gently, but there&rsquo;s no escape that programming at the beginning will be challenging.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember the last time I had a chance to see someone take their first steps in programming but being there to make their path easier was definitely worth it.</p>
<p>Also, thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/samirtalwar">Samir</a> for mentioning it and <a href="https://twitter.com/despo">despo</a> for organising it. I hope to be able to do it again soon.</p>
