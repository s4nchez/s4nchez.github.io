<p>That&rsquo;s why I believe is important to be conscious about what happens during them. A stand-up meeting may hide problems if:</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t have an exact time to start</li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t happen because someone is not present</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a trigger for technical discussions</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not focused on to the plan</li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t contribute to continuous improvement</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a report for a single person, not the team</li>
<li>People don&rsquo;t stay close to each other</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s frequently interrupted</li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t include the whole team</li>
<li>People don&rsquo;t remember what they did on the last day</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s moment where most of the problems are raised</li>
<li>It takes more than 15 minutes</li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t happen every day</li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t feel good</li>
